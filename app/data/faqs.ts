    question: "How do you handle data privacy and compliance?",
    answer: "We take data security seriously. All data is encrypted at rest and in transit using bank-level encryption. We're SOC 2 Type II compliant and never share your data with third parties. Your deal flow and financial information stays yours."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you integrate with my CRM (GoHighLevel, HubSpot, Podio)?",
    answer: "Yes! We have native integrations with GoHighLevel, HubSpot, Podio, and most major CRMs. If your CRM has an API, we can connect to it. Setup typically takes 30 minutes with our guided onboarding."
  },
  {
    question: "What if my deals are all off-market — no MLS?",
    answer: "Perfect! Our system is built for all deal sources. We aggregate leads from wholesaler lists, direct mail campaigns, driving for dollars apps, and any custom sources you use. The AI analyzer works with any property data you provide."
  },
  {
    question: "How fast can we start seeing value?",
    answer: "Most investors see immediate value during the free audit where we identify 3-5 quick wins. After the 2-3 week pilot, you'll have working automations saving you hours per week. Full implementation typically shows 10-20 hours saved monthly."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a developer on my team?",
    answer: "Not at all. We handle all the technical setup and maintenance. Your team gets simple training on using the dashboards and tools. If you ever need changes, we handle those too - no coding required on your end."
  },
  {
    question: "What size portfolios do you work with?",
    answer: "We work with everyone from solo flippers doing 2-3 deals per year to funds managing 50+ active projects. Our automations scale with you - start small and add more as you grow."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does this cost?",
    answer: "Pricing depends on your deal volume and which automations you need. The audit is always free. Most investors see ROI within the first month just from time savings. We offer monthly plans starting at $497 with no long-term contracts."
  },
  {
    question: "Can this help with hard money and private lender management?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Our draw package builder and milestone tracking are designed specifically for hard money requirements. We automate progress photos, invoice compilation, and can even send updates directly to your lenders."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer training for my team?",
    answer: "Yes, training is included. We provide video tutorials, live onboarding sessions, and ongoing support. Most team members are comfortable with the system in under an hour."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I already have some automations in place?",
    answer: "Great! We'll audit your existing setup and identify gaps. Often we can enhance what you have rather than replacing it. Our goal is to complement your current systems, not disrupt what's working."
